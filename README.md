An analysis of Netflix data from Kaggle using R.


My name is Avi Kodali, and I am a freshman majoring in Statistics, and minoring in Computer Science. I enjoy analyzing large datasets to squeeze out any useful insights and information and transforming that insight into solutions. As such, I aspire to be a data scientist. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people all around the world found themselves stuck inside their homes. They could not hang out with their friends or go outside to have their usual fun. So stuck inside their homes, they had to find other ways to cope with quarantine. One of the most popular ways to maintain their sanity through the boredom of quarantine life was to binge shows on popular streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. My family, for example, have watched at least 30 Netflix and Amazon Prime shows in the past year, while stuck at home.  Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to look at a data on shows on Netflix and see what interesting things I can find. 

I found my dataset from Kaggle, at this URL:  https://www.kaggle.com/harshitshankhdhar/netflix-and-amazon-prime-tv-series-dataset. This dataset has five categories:  the title of the show, the genre of the show, the premiere date of the show on its platform, the number of seasons in the show, and the number of episodes in the show. 

First, I decided to see which genre of tv series occurred the most on Netflix and Amazon Prime. To do this, I made a bar graph that showed the frequency of each genre in the dataset.
